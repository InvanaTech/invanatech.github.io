            <p>Invana works on top of graph databases that support <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/">Apache
                TinkerPop</a>.
                Apache TinkerPop&trade; is an opensource graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP)
                and graph analytic systems (OLAP) maintained by Apache Software Foundation. </p>

            <p>Invana has two components - invana engine and invana studio,
                which are intentionally separated as projects to decouple the GraphQL API
                and the User Interface people interact with respectively.
