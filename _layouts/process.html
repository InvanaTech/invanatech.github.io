                    Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation
                    that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people,

                    <p>Every problem is unique, and solving them takes different amount
                        of time depending on its complexity. To solve a problem, we need to
                        look into its roots, do research and validate our ideas. Without a
                        proper plan, we can easily get lost in the time. So we need to understand
                        the product vision, business goals, constraints from technology and market
                        along with a powerful process to make a perfect and detailed plan; which
                        ultimately helps in smooth execution. Our process explained below is very
                        fluid in nature and always focuses on bringing best results for the capital spent.

                        our
                        opportunities in the market. And we define the personas and scenarios accordingly.

                        help of journey maps. We can now have a proper hypothesis defined for our product.

                        and iterations, we can freeze our product specifications and document them.

                        constantly deploy and maintain the quality of the final
                        product.
