project_title: Importing Cell pathway data into OrientDB
project_abstract: "Graph Data and Graph Computing has been an interesting way to understand and record
the relations between data and we are employing the same technology that powers social networking sites like Facebook and more. We are employing the same technology to connect the dots in cell pathways and find easy
paths in the cell pathways, which could potentially assist scientists in choosing the write drug target macromolecules. This project is more like extending the work by Byoung-Ha Yoon et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389944/pdf/gni-15-19.pdf with another graphdb tool - OrientDB (https://orientdb.com)  "
