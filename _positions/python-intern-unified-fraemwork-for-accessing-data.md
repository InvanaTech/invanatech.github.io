---

The project aims at creating a unified framework that can provide access to different services and forms of data like searching web, videos, wikipedia, dictionary(thesaurus etc for NLP like services) in the following domains:

- web search apis ([google](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview#Pricing) and [bing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) for now)
- video search ([youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python))
- Wikipedia ([Wikipedia-API/](https://github.com/martin-majlis/Wikipedia-API/) or [Wikipedia](https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia))
- Thesaurus (https://github.com/Manwholikespie/thesaurus-api)
- and more..

This framework make the developers communicate and map the data between different sources.
